/*Pressure Drop Across A Valve Source Code
This is the source code for calculating the pressure drop across a valve by interacting with the user.
The program is to be written where an engineer can select the type of valve being dealt with, input the needed information, 
and a theoretical pressure drop across that valve will be calculated. 

The second part of this program will ask the engineer what the recorded pressure drop is,
and will provide a %error.
