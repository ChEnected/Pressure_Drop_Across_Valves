# The Purpose of this Repository
I am a Chemical Engineer from the University of Mississippi and have begun to learn how to code programs. 
There are many tedious tasks that I must do repeatedly such as the first program I have written, deltaPValve.
This program will prompt the inputs, do the necessary unit conversions, and begin to ouput relevant data.

I plan on using the functions of GitHub to keep myself organized, and be able to multitask on many different programs as their needs arise throughout my career.
